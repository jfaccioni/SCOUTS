Quickstart
==========
When you start SCOUT, you should see this:

.. image:: ../images/SCOUT_main.png
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: SCOUT main window
   :align: center

These are your main options for the analysis:

.. image:: ../images/SCOUT_main_info.png
   :scale: 70%
   :alt: SCOUT main window - information
   :align: center

Sample names are particularly important (if the application does not find a given sample, it warns you and stops the analysis). Click here to select and edit them:

.. image:: ../images/SCOUT_main_samples.png
   :scale: 70%
   :alt: SCOUT main window - sample button
   :align: center

In this window you can inform SCOUT what your samples are named. You don't have to use the full sample name - any identifier exclusive to each sample is enough, as long as it is part of your samples in your input. Don't forget to add a control sample, too.

   :scale: 80%

   :align: center

`How SCOUT works <./work.html>`_ has a detailed explanation of how the program reads and parses sample names.

You can also gate your samples, if you want:

.. image:: ../images/SCOUT_main_gates.png
   :scale: 80%
   :alt: SCOUT main window - gates button
   :align: center

The gating functionality works differently for Cytof and RNAseq samples. Refer to `How SCOUT works <./work.html>`_ for details.
