**SCOUTS**
==========

Single Cell OUTlier Selector
----------------------------

**SCOUTS** is a tool that quickly finds outliers in your single-cell data, generating information about your population organized by targeted molecules.

SCOUTS takes your single-cell input and generates output files containing only outliers. The method used by SCOUTS to subset the population and find the outliers is customizable through the program's interface.
