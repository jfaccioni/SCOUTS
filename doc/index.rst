**SCOUTS**
==========

Single Cell Outlier Selector
----------------------------

**SCOUTS** is a tool that quickly finds **outliers in your single-cell data**, generating information about your cell population organized by markers. It is designed to analyse **mass cytometry (CyToF)** and **single-cell RNA sequencing** data (scRNASeq).

Why SCOUTS?
***********

SCOUTS takes your single-cell input and generates output files containing only outliers. The method used by SCOUTS to subset the population and find the outliers is customizable through the program's interface.

Many single-cell analytical pipelines require some level of programming knowledge in order to be used. While some great tools for languages like R, Python and Julia have been developed, the entry-level barrier of programming is still intimidating for many scientists starting on the field of singe-cell analysis. With this in mind, we developed SCOUTS to simplify this process. Through a desktop application, the user is able to choose the parameters for the outlier selection, and leave the hard work of programmatically subsetting the data to SCOUTS.

As a showcase of how to interpret and explore the data generated by SCOUTS, we developed **SCOUTS-violins**, a secondary desktop application which displays the outlier populations identified by SCOUTS as violin plots.
